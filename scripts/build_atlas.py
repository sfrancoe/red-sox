"""Build docs/atlas/hub-ball-atlas.html, an interactive 3D map of this repository.

Every tracked file is measured (lines of code; generated data by bytes), grouped
into systems and feature groups, and linked by the connections detected between
them: Swift type references, JS/Python imports, workflow -> script runs, script ->
data writes, app -> API calls and test coverage. The graph is embedded into
docs/atlas/template.html so the output is one self-contained, offline HTML file.

    python3 scripts/build_atlas.py            # rebuild the atlas
    python3 scripts/build_atlas.py --json -   # print the graph JSON instead
