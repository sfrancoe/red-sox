"""Fetch real Red Sox game-by-game results from the MLB Stats API.

Writes data/seasons.json (the shape the chart engine expects) and data/meta.json.

The MLB Stats API is free and needs no key. Each game carries the team's running
`leagueRecord`, so one call per season gives the full W/L path.

Uses only the standard library so CI needs no dependencies.
